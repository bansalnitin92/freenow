freenow backend test


## I have broken down the task into three individual test cases checking various use cases for individual scenarios.Hence giving coverage for individual APIs.

## Putting assertions only in email syntex assuming this is the main goal to assert.

## Making test cases independent of each other so that they can run individually.

## At the time of submitting code, hitting GET API 'comments?postId=24' giving application error. Because of that 1 test case is getting skipped. I hope that's considerable reason.

## Build in circleCI was getting failed due to surefire-plugin issue. Added a workaround in pom.xml.
